/// # Overview
///
/// Tizen WASM Player is a Samsung TV extension API which grants a WebAssembly
/// application low level access to a Platform's media player. WASM Player
/// operates on Elementary Stream Packet level, accepting encoded packets that
/// are decoded and rendered by the TV multimedia pipeline. Depending on
/// operation mode, it is fit to be used either as a video on-demand player
/// (normal latency mode, suitable for adaptive streaming scenarios) or as a
/// streaming player (low latency mode).
///
/// As a low level media API, WASM Player is responsible only for decoding and
/// rendering media content. Acquiring media content and splitting it into
/// Elementary Media Packets that are passed to the player is entirely dependent
/// on App. This allows for a great flexibility: the application has full
/// control over downloading data, demuxing, either low latency or adaptive
/// streaming protocol implementation, etc. When EMSS is used major part of
/// multimedia pipeline can be implemented as a WebAssembly module and it is
/// platform-independent, allowing for a wide variety of multimedia
/// applications.

/// @brief
/// Main class of WASM Player. `ElementaryMediaStreamSource` acts as a *data
/// source* for `html::HTMLMediaElement`.
///
/// `ElementaryMediaStreamSource` manages a set of `ElementaryMediaTrack`
/// objects. `ElementaryMediaPacket`s that media consists of are sent to WASM
/// Player via individual tracks added to the source.
///
/// # Usage overview:
///
/// ## Setup
///
/// -# Create an instance of `html::HTMLMediaElement` and attach an object
///    implementing the `html::HTMLMediaElementListener` interface.
/// -# Create an instance of `ElementaryMediaStreamSource` and attach an object
///    implementing the `ElementaryMediaStreamSourceListener` interface.
/// -# Associate media element with source using
///    `html::HTMLMediaElement::SetSrc()`. This triggers source transition from
///    `ReadyState::kDetached` to `ReadyState::kClosed`.
/// -# Add `ElementaryMediaTrack`s that will provide data for the media stream
///    using `ElementaryMediaStreamSource::AddTrack()`.
///    - do not add tracks if they are not used (e.g. do not add audio track if
///      stream doesn't have audio),
///    - attach an instance of `ElementaryMediaTrackListener` interface
///      implementation to each track.
/// -# Set duration of the stream using
///    `ElementaryMediaStreamSource::SetDuration()`. This step is skipped if low
///    latency mode is used.
/// -# Call `ElementaryMediaStreamSource::Open()` to conclude setup. Setup is
///    complete once source changes state from `ReadyState::kClosed` to
///    `ReadyState::kOpen`.
///
/// ## Sending data for playback
///
/// `ElementaryMediaStreamSource` is a data source. It provides elementary media
/// data for Media Player to play. `html::MediaElement` is a playback control
/// element: it controls when media is to be played, paused, seeked, and so on.
///
/// Changing configuration of the source and sending data will cause
/// `HTMLMediaElement::ReadyState` to change. Similarly, interacting with
/// `html::MediaElement` will impact `ElementaryMediaStreamSource`. Application
/// should listen to `ElementaryMediaStreamSourceListener` and all
/// `ElementaryMediaTrackListener`s and react accordingly.
///
/// Most notably, changes in both source and track states will inform
/// application when it should send elementary media data to Media Player for
/// playback:
/// * when the source enters `ReadyState::kOpen` (and each track receives
///  `ElementaryMediaTrackListener::OnTrackOpen()`) Media Player is ready to
///  accept data,
/// * when the source leaves `ReadyState::kOpen` (and each track receives
///  `ElementaryMediaTrackListener::OnTrackClosed()`) Media Player won't accept
///  any more data.
///
/// @note It's recommended to use `ElementaryMediaTrackListener` to track when
///       data should be sent to Media Player.
///
/// A single `ElementaryMediaPacket` is sent to Media Player using the
/// `ElementaryMediaTrack::AppendPacket()` method.
///
/// ### Sending data in the normal mode
///
/// When `Mode::kNormal` is used, App should track current playback position
/// using `ElementaryMediaStreamSourceListener::OnPlaybackPositionChanged()`.
/// Media Player uses buffering in this mode to ensure playback is smooth and
/// App can use current playback position information to ensure packet buffer
/// underrun doesn't happen:
/// * for clear (non-encrypted) content playback at most 64 MiB of data can be
///   buffered,
/// * for DRM-protected content playback at most 10 MiB of data can be buffered,
/// * for audio track at most 768 KiB of data can be buffered,
/// * App can buffer up to 3 seconds of content ahead of the current playback
///   position.
///
/// ### Sending data in the low latency mode
///
/// When `Mode::kLowLatency` is used, Media Player will render packets
/// immediately after they are sent. No internal buffering happens in Media
/// Player. Since this mode is intended for live sources, usually it's a good
/// idea to hand packets to the source right after they are received by App.
